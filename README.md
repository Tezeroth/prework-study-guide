# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website is intended to be student note book of sorts, for the edx UX/UI course. it contains html, css, and javascript, and most importantly was iterated and improved on using the gitbash and github work flow.

One of the main motivations behind creating this is knowing that there are going to be a lot of tags, selectors, and syntax rules, and processes to learn for front end development. 

I found the git hub workflow to be a little overwhelming, and somewhat intimidating at first, not understanding the concepts of staging, commits, PR, pulls etc and actually managed to lose work by trying to be nosey and switching brances and hitting merge conflicts etc but patience and persistance win the day.

From this project I learnt the very basics of html, css, and javascript, and most importantly the VScode/gitbash/github workflow.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
